          <div class="content-wrapper">

            <p>I was approached by this client with her need for a website that captured her personality in just a few pages and allowed her to connect with current and future patients. She owns her own counceling business and wanted to connect with clients outside of her Psychology Today landing page that was automatically generated for her.</p>

            <p>I worked with Mrs. DeVries over the course of one week &mdash; From our first conversation, to handing her site over to her, I was able to complete this project in five days. I am proud to have been approached by Mrs. DeVries, and to have been able to provide her with exactly what she asked for in under the time we agreed upon.</p>

            <div class="floating-image">

            <figure id="jdv-logo">
              <img src="../img/jdv-logo.jpg" alt="jdv logo" />
            </figure>

            </div>

            <p>I was given complete artisitic control over this project &mdash; I made design-based decisions as I wrote the code for website from scratch. I designed the client's color palette and layout around her business logo she provided me. I showed her two different design concepts for her website and let her choose which site she felt represented her personality the most.</p>

            <p>Ultimately, Judy wanted a website that looked modern, updated, and approachable. I wanted her to feel that she had a say in the creative process for her site, and I'm thankful she ultimately loved the final product. She is proud to give her business card out to clients, knowing her website represents who she is and why she loves her line of work.</p>
